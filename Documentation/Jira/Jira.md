#Jira
We use Jira as our central issue management tool.

> Jira is out single point of truth. 
> * We do not develop anything that is not documented as an issue in jira
> * We do request software development tasks only via Jira

## Projects in Jira
One versioned artifact -> One Jira Project (and usually one repository)

## Jira and Git
When working on Jira issues we create a branch in Git.
