# Solution Structure

## Solution Structure and Filesystem
The solution structure and (projects, project folders) must match the structure and naming on the filesystem.

#### Project Naming

## One-class-per-type
We use the one class per type approach. I.e. classes, interfaces, DelegateTypes all go into separate files.
