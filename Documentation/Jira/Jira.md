# Jira
We use Jira as our central issue management tool.

> Jira is our single point of truth. 
> * We do not develop anything that is not documented as an issue in Jira.
> * We do request software development tasks only via Jira.

## Projects in Jira
One versioned artifact -> One Jira Project (and usually one repository).

## Jira and Git
When working on Jira issues we create a branch in Git.
